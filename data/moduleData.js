These include your income, expenses, existing loans, location, and the size of the house.Income: Your gross monthly income, including bonuses and other sources of income, is critical in determining the maximum monthly mortgage payment you can afford.Expenses: All regular monthly expenses, such as rent, utilities, food, transportation, and insurance, must be taken into account along with the mortgage payment to ensure you can maintain your lifestyle while paying for the new property.Existing loans: Your car loans, student loans, and credit card debt can impact your budget for buying a house. Consider these loans and their monthly payments, as well as your debt-to-income ratio, which is the total amount of debt payments divided by gross monthly income. A high debt-to-income ratio can limit the amount you can borrow or affect your ability to qualify for a mortgage.",
